# CatMap
Welcome to CatMap! This innovative web application provides real-time information about the availability of parking spaces on campus. With the help of this app, you can easily locate the nearest parking lot and determine how full it is at the moment.

## How it Works
The map displays each parking lot with a pin, and the color of the pin indicates the current level of occupancy. Green pins indicate that the parking lot has spots available and red pins indicate that the parking lot is full. This way, you can make an informed decision about where to park and save time searching for a spot.

You can also select the pin to see the selected parking lot's occupancy level. This information will help you decide whether you should park in that parking lot or move on to the next one.
